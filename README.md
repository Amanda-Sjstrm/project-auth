# Project Auth API

The aim of this project was to build an API with authentication to implement a registration flow, and a frontend with forms to register, sign in, and view some content once you're logged in.

## The problem
We followed the code-along/live sessions quite to closely, and managed to build project from that. We worked in branches throughout the whole projects. The biggest problem was getting the connection to the database in Atlas to work, and we found that one connection worked while the other didn't. 
If we had more time, we would work on styling the frontend and making it more user friendly. We could refactor the code alot, and make it shorter. There are some small bugs that we would fix as well.
Tools used for this project: React, JavaScript, Redux, HTML5, CSS, Styled Components, Express API, MongoDB, Mongoose.
